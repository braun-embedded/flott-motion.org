Flott, the motion control toolkit for Rust applications, exists. I don't have much else to say right now, but I plan to post an announcement with some more details, specifically the libraries that are already available and the larger vision, at a later date.

For now, feel free to check out the [Flott repositories on GitHub][Flott]. If you're interested and want to follow the project, please sign up to the [Atom feed][Atom].
