[Stepper Terminal](https://github.com/flott-motion/stepper-terminal) is a CLI application and microcontroller firmware that allows you to control a stepper motor from your terminal. It is based on the [Stepper](https://github.com/flott-motion/stepper) library.

Stepper Terminal is a tool intended for manual testing of Stepper. But it also serves as a full usage example for Stepper. So if you've been wondering how you can use Stepper in your own application, maybe Stepper Terminal can provide some inspiration.


### Flott

Stepper Terminal and Stepper are part of [Flott](https://flott-motion.org/), the open source toolkit for motion control software in Rust. For now, Flott is restricted to interfacing with stepper motors, but I plan to eventually grow it into a comprehensive toolkit that covers all common motion control needs.


### Funding

Creating and maintaining open source software is time-consuming! If you want to support my work on Stepper and Flott, [please consider sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun).
